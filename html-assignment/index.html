        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Cesar Berrio. I'm a <em>Colombian International Student</em> who is 19 years old. In June 21<sup>st</sup> 2019 I graduated from High School. In the same year, I decided to move to Brisbane, <abbr title= "Australia">AU</abbr>, learn English, and eventually came back to Colombia due to the pandemic. During my time back in Colombia, I studied English, did <abbr title= "Neuro Linguistic Programming" >NLP</abbr> Dioplma and certified myself as a spiritual coach. </p>

          <p>
          One of the things I enjoy the most is playing soccer, a sport I have played since I was seven years old. Also, I love listening to music. I am really into reggaeton, and my favourite singer is Don Omar. In addition, superhero movies appeal to me, and I love associating the movie history with the hero journey and analyzing the construction of the characters.
            </p>
